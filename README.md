# Deep Learning Challenge
UCI Bootcamp Module 21 Challenge - Deep Learning Challenge


Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. The purpose of the analysis is, to create a binary classifier by using machine learning and neural networks, on the dataset's features that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Optimizer No 1

* Number of Hidden Layers = 2

* Number of Neurons for each Layer

* hidden_nodes_layer1 = 40

* hidden_nodes_layer2 = 15

* Activation Function used = RELU

### Result:
* There was no noticeable change in the first attempt.

### Optimizer No 2

* Number of Hidden Layers = 3

* Number of Neurons for each Layer

* hidden_nodes_layer1 = 60

* hidden_nodes_layer2 = 25

* hidden_nodes_layer2 = 10

* Activation Function used = RELU

### Result:

* Making above changes to the model displays the accuracy of 72%.


### Optimizer No 3

* Number of Hidden Layers = 3

* Number of Neurons for each Layer

* hidden_nodes_layer1 = 100

* hidden_nodes_layer2 = 50

* hidden_nodes_layer2 = 25

* Activation Function used = RELU

* For Optimising the Model in this attempt 'Name' column is included and used binning for rare occurrences (for less than 10 value counts).

## Result:

### Making above changes to the model increased the accuracy to 78%.

Four jupyter files are starting from initial AlphabetSoupCharity to 3AlphabetSoupCharity and also there are 4 HDF5 files all stored in the repository. 
The initial jupyter notebook has the basic model and the other 3 jupyter files have optimization attempts with different alterations of hidden layers, neurons, features, and so on. A detailed Report has been attached explaining every step related to the process. 

### In the third attempt, an accuracy of 78% has been achieved.
